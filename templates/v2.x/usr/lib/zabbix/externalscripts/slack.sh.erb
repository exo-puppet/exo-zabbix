# Slack incoming web-hook URL and user name
url='<%= scope['zabbix::slack_webhook_url'] %>'    # example: https://hooks.slack.com/services/QW3R7Y/D34DC0D3/BCADFGabcDEF123
username='Zabbix'

## Values received by this script:
# To = $1 (Slack channel or user to send the message to, specified in the Zabbix web interface; "@username" or "#channel")
# Subject = $2 (usually either PROBLEM or RECOVERY)
# Message = $3 (whatever message the Zabbix action sends, preferably something like "Zabbix server is unreachable for 5 minutes - Zabbix server (127.0.0.1)")

# Get the Slack channel or user ($1) and Zabbix subject ($2 - hopefully either PROBLEM or RECOVERY)
to="$1"
subject="$2"

# The message that we want to send to Slack is the "subject" value ($2 / $subject - that we got earlier)
#  followed by the message that Zabbix actually sent us ($3)
message="${subject}: $3"

# Build our JSON payload and send it as a POST request to the Slack incoming web-hook URL
payload="payload={\"channel\": \"${to}\", \"username\": \"${username}\", \"text\": \"${message}\", \"icon_emoji\": \"${emoji}\"}"
curl -m 5 --data-urlencode "${payload}" $url
